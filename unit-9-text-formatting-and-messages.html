<h1>Unit 9: Text Formatting and Message</h1>
<p>
Learning goals for this unit are:
<ol>
<li>Using subclasses of the <span class="code">Format</span> class to prepare various kinds of information for display.</li>
<li>Using the <span class="code">BigDecimal</span> class to handle decimal values.</li>
<li>Combining message formatting with internationalization.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>User Story 1: Formatting currency values</h2>
<p>
To implement the following User Story, write a method that computes the final amount due by applying a tax rate to the total sale price. Look up the <span class="code">BigDecimal</span> class to see how to perform arithmetic operations on decimal values and control rounding. Then write a method that formats the computed value for display. Look up the <span class="code">DecimalFormat</span> class to see how to format decimal values to include commas, decimal points, and currency symbols while suppressing the display of leading zeroes.

  Feature: As a programmer, I want to be able to format numerical values for logging and for display
    so that the messages will convey clear information

  Scenario: Formatting currency values
    Given no locale is set
    And the default locale is "US English"
    And the total sale price is 1,849.58 dollars
    And the sales tax rate is 7.5%
    When I request the amount due
    Then the result is "$1,988.30"

    Given locale "Germany" is set
    And the total sale price is 1,849.58 euro
    And the sales tax rate is 7.5%
    When I request the amount due
    Then the result is "1.988,30 €"
</pre>
</div>
</p>
<h2>User Story 2: Formatting messages</h2>
<p>
To implement the following user story, read about the <span class="code">MessageFormat</span> class and how to define placeholders in messages for values that you supply at runtime. Message text is supplied that you can use to populate <span class="code">.properties</span> files to back a <span class="code">ResourceBundle</span> for localized messages. You will have to put the numbered placeholders in the appropriate places in the messages. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the substitution variables occur in a different order for different languages, depending on how statements are formulated in each language. For example, in the &quot;Printer is out of paper&quot; scenario, the paper size occurs first in the French version while the tray number occurs first in the Japanese version. Your Java code should not have to know about this; you can handle it by defining the placeholders in the message text appropriately.

  Scenario: Printer is jammed
    Given no locale is set
    And the default locale is "US English"
    When printer "2FL899" is jammed
    Then it displays "Printer 2FL899: paper jam" 

    Given locale "Germany" is set
    When printer "2FL899" is jammed
    Then it displays "Drucker 2FL899: Papierstau" 

  Scenario: Printer is out of paper
    Given locale "France" is set
    When the printer is out of paper
    Then it displays "Chargez du papier A4 dans le bac 3" 

    Given locale "Japan" is set
    When the printer is out of paper
    Then it displays "トレイ3にA4サイズの用紙をセットしてください"
