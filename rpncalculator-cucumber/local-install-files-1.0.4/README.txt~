The java_pageobject project is not yet available in the maven central repository.

Until it has been added to the central repository, add it to your project like this:

1. Copy the jar file and the script, mvn-local-install, to any convenient location on your system.

2. Run the script, mvn-local-install. This will install the jar in your local maven repository, 
located at [home]/.m2/repository

3. Add the contents of the file, dependency.xml, to your project pom.xml file. 

To make the jar available to tools other than maven, use the procedures that normally apply to those tools.
