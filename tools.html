<h2>Java Development Kit</h2>
<p>
A Java Development Kit includes a Java runtime, compiler, jar utility, and javadoc utility. Many popular operating systems have a Java runtime bundled with them, but they do not have a Java development kit already installed. For this class you can use an &quot;official&quot; JDK from Oracle Corporation or the Open JDK, and you can use either version 1.6 or 1.7 of Java.

<h2>Maven</h2>
<p>
Maven is a dependency manager and build utility. It locates and downloads jar files your project needs, and it can build your project and run your automated test suites. (Other dependency managers and build utilities are available that support Java projects, as well.) We will use Maven to install most of the dependencies for class programming exercises. Please install version 3.0.4 or later.
</p>

<a name="eclipse"/>
<h2>Eclipse IDE</h2>
<p>
Eclipse is an integrated development environment, or IDE. An IDE provides a unified execution environment for a set of software development tools that usually includes a language-aware text editor, compiler, debugger, console output capture, test runner, and a mechanism to execute system commands. Additional tools may be included, as well. 
</p>
<p>
Eclipse is a popular IDE for Java programming, and is distributed free of charge. Other IDEs also support Java programming, and the companies where you work may use different IDEs. We will use Eclipse in this class.

<a name="m2eclipse"/>
<h2>m2eclipse Plug-in</h2>
<p>
Eclipse has a plug-in architecture, which means you can find and install various add-on software to support specific software development needs. Plug-ins are available that help us integrate Maven with Eclipse projects. We will use one of them, called m2eclipse, in this class. 
</p>
<p>
To install m2eclipse, start Eclipse and use its built-in mechanism to download and install plug-ins. Instructions are available at <a href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/" target="_blank">http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/</a>, including instructions on how to install plug-ins generally.
