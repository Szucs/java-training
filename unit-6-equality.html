<h1>Unit 6: Equality</h1>
<p>
Comparing two instances for equality is a little more complicated that you might expect. In this unit, you will explore the problem of instance equality in some depth.
</p>
<p>
The goals of this unit are:
<ol>
<li>Explore the problem of equality between instances of Java objects;</li>
<li>Learn about an assertion framework known as Hamcrest, that offers a somewhat more robust way of asserting the expected results of test cases than the assertions available with JUnit alone; and</li> 
<li>Learn about Java <em>interfaces</em>, which is one of the mechanisms by which the Java language supports the object-oriented concept of <em>abstraction</em></li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The first step is to set up an Eclipse/Maven project for the unit, named <em>equality</em>. By now you know how to do this. You can copy the POM from Unit 4 and change the names of things; the structure and dependencies defined in the POM are the same for this unit.

Here is the User Story for Unit 5:

  Feature:
    As a Java programmer, I want to learn how to use Java's facilities 
    for comparing instances for equality so that I can be a more effective 
    Java professional.

  Scenario: Comparing two Double instances
    Given a Double with value 12.5
    And a Double with value 10.25
    When I compare the instances using equals
    Then the result is false

    Given a Double with value 12.5
    And a Double with vvalue 10.25
    When I compare the instances using compareTo
    Then the result is -1

  Scenario: Comparing instances of a custom class
    Given a Person class with a String attribute of "name"
    And a Person instance with "name" of "John"
    And a Person instance with "name" of "Mary"    
    When I compare the instances using equals
    Then the result is false

    Given a Person class with a String attribute of "name"
    And a Person instance with "name" of "John"
    And a different Person instance with "name" of "John"    
    When I compare the instances using equals
    Then the result is true

    Given a Person class with a String attribute of "name"
    And a Person instance with "name" of "John"
    And a different Person instance with "name" of "John"    
    When I compare the instances using the equality operator
    Then the result is false

    Given a Person class with a String attribute of "name"
    And a Person instance with "name" of "John"
    When I compare the instance to itself using the equality operator
    Then the result is true

    Given a Person class with a String attribute of "name"
    And a Person instance with "name" of "John"
    When I compare the instance to a String value of "John" using equals
    Then the result is false
